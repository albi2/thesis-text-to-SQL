# Handoff: Pipeline Structure Implementation - 2025-05-25

## Summary

This handoff summarizes the implementation of the core pipeline structure for the Text-to-SQL framework. The design utilizes the Chain of Responsibility and Builder patterns to create a flexible and extensible execution flow for processing natural language queries.

## Implemented Components

-   **`PipelineStepInput`**: A base class (`src/pipeline/pipeline_step_input.py`) for defining step-specific input data structures.
-   **`PipelineStep`**: An abstract base class (`src/pipeline/pipeline_step.py`) implementing the Chain of Responsibility pattern. It includes `before`, `handle_execution` (abstract), `after`, and `should_execute` methods for conditional execution. Steps are linked using the `link_with` method. It is generic over the Context and Input types.
-   **`Pipeline`**: The main pipeline class (`src/pipeline/pipeline.py`) which holds the first step of the chain and initiates execution via the `run` method. It is generic over the Context type.
-   **`Pipeline.Builder`**: A nested class within `Pipeline` (`src/pipeline/pipeline.py`) following the Builder pattern to assemble the pipeline chain by adding steps.
-   **`PipelineContext`**: The context object (`src/context/pipeline_context.py`) that flows through the pipeline. It inherits from `GenericContext` and has been updated to track the `last_executed_step`.

## Pipeline Creation Flow

The pipeline is constructed using the `Pipeline.Builder`. Steps are added to the builder in the desired order using the `add_step` method, which internally links them using the `PipelineStep.link_with` method to form the chain. The `build` method then returns the configured `Pipeline` instance.

Example (from `src/main.py`):

```python
pipeline = Pipeline[PipelineContext].Builder() \
    .add_step(NoOpPipelineStep("Step 1")) \
    .add_step(NoOpPipelineStep("Step 2")) \
    .add_step(NoOpPipelineStep("Step 3")) \
    .build()

initial_context = PipelineContext(...) # Initialize context
pipeline.run(initial_context) # Run the pipeline
```

## Possible Improvements

During the design process, several potential improvements were discussed to enhance the pipeline's robustness and flexibility:

1.  **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement a standardized mechanism for steps to report errors and for the pipeline to handle exceptions gracefully, potentially allowing for partial execution or specific error handling steps.
2.  **Step Configuration and Validation**: Introduce dedicated configuration objects or validation methods for complex steps to ensure proper setup before execution.
3.  **Observability/Logging within Steps**: Standardize logging by passing a logger instance through the context or to step constructors for centralized configuration and richer logging.

These improvements could be considered in future development phases to make the pipeline more resilient and easier to debug and manage.

## Next Steps

The core pipeline structure is in place. The next phase involves implementing concrete `PipelineStep` instances for the various components outlined in the project plan (e.g., Schema Pruning, Column Linking, Multi-Path Generation) and integrating them into the pipeline flow.
