# Milestone 1 Summary: Database and Schema Engine - 2025-05-25

## Overall Summary

This milestone focused on setting up the foundational components for database interaction and schema handling within the Text-to-SQL framework. Key achievements include integrating the M-Schema library, implementing robust configuration management, and establishing a flexible factory pattern for creating schema engines. Architectural improvements were made to reduce coupling and improve maintainability.

## Key Accomplishments

1.  **M-Schema Integration:** The core components of the M-Schema library from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/XGenerationLab/M-Schema) were rewritten and integrated into the project structure under `src/components/schema` and `src/util`. This involved adapting the original `m_schema.py`, `schema_engine.py`, and `utils.py` files and adjusting imports for their new locations.
2.  **Configuration Management:** A generic `ConfigurationHelper` class (`src/common/config/config_manager.py`) was created to centralize the loading of settings from YAML files (`config/database.yaml`, `config/schema_engine.yaml`). This standardizes configuration access and improves flexibility.
3.  **Constants Implementation:** Dedicated constants classes (`src/util/constants.py`) (`DatabaseConfigKeys`, `DatabaseConstants`) were introduced to store configuration keys and SQL query strings, eliminating hardcoded strings and improving code maintainability.
4.  **Schema Engine Factory:** The Factory pattern was implemented with `SchemaEngineFactory` (`src/components/schema/schema_engine_factory.py`) to centralize the creation logic for `SchemaEngine` instances based on configuration, decoupling its instantiation from other components.
5.  **Database Manager Refactoring:** The `DatabaseManager` (`src/infrastructure/database/database_manager.py`) was refactored to rely on the `ConfigurationHelper` and delegate `SchemaEngine` creation to the factory, improving modularity and testability.

## Key Decisions

-   Using YAML files for configuration to allow easy modification without code changes.
-   Adopting a factory pattern for schema engine creation to support future expansion with new schema types.
-   Applying the single responsibility principle to schema components for better maintainability.

## Discoveries & Lessons Learned

-   The `apply_diff` tool can be sensitive to subtle differences; re-reading the file before applying diffs is crucial for accuracy. `write_to_file` was necessary for larger code changes when `apply_diff` failed.
-   Proper configuration management is essential for handling different database environments and schema engine settings.
-   The initial design of the schema engine required significant refactoring to effectively separate concerns.
-   Using libraries like PyYAML for configuration parsing and SQLAlchemy for database interaction provides robust solutions.

## Problems & Solutions

-   **Problem**: Configuration loading and access were not centralized or standardized.
    **Solution**: Created `ConfigurationHelper` (`src/common/config/config_manager.py`).
-   **Problem**: Hardcoded strings were used for configuration keys and SQL queries.
    **Solution**: Introduced dedicated constants classes (`src/util/constants.py`).
-   **Problem**: Direct instantiation of `SchemaEngine` created tight coupling.
    **Solution**: Implemented `SchemaEngineFactory` (`src/components/schema/schema_engine_factory.py`).
-   **Problem**: `DatabaseManager` was tightly coupled with configuration loading and `SchemaEngine` creation.
    **Solution**: Decoupled `DatabaseManager` by using `ConfigurationHelper` and `SchemaEngineFactory`.

## Work in Progress

-   Database connection and creation logic in `DatabaseManager` requires full implementation using SQLAlchemy (currently has placeholder comments). (5%)
-   `SchemaEngineFactory` creates `SchemaEngine` but does not yet pass the active database connection/engine to it. (80%)

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)

-   **HIGH**: Implement actual database connection logic in `DatabaseManager._connect`.
-   **HIGH**: Implement actual database creation logic in `DatabaseManager._ensure_database_exists`.
-   **MEDIUM**: Pass the SQLAlchemy connection or engine to `SchemaEngine` in `SchemaEngineFactory.create_schema_engine`.
-   **LOW**: Review and refine configuration parameters in `config/database.yaml` and `config/schema_engine.yaml`.
