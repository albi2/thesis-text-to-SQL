# Database and Schema Engine Milestone Summary - 2025-05-25

## Changes Implemented
- Implemented database connection management using `database_manager.py`.
- Developed a flexible schema engine capable of handling different schema types.
- Created a schema engine factory (`schema_engine_factory.py`) for dynamic engine instantiation.
- Integrated configuration loading for database and schema engine settings using `config_manager.py`.

## Key Decisions
- Decided to use YAML files (`config/database.yaml`, `config/schema_engine.yaml`) for configuration to allow easy modification without code changes.
- Chose a factory pattern for schema engine creation to support future expansion with new schema types.
- Refactored schema components to adhere to the single responsibility principle for better maintainability.

## Discoveries
- The initial design of the schema engine needed significant refactoring to separate concerns effectively.
- Proper configuration management is essential for handling different database environments and schema engine settings.

## Current System State
- Database connection can be established based on `config/database.yaml`.
- Schema engines can be created based on `config/schema_engine.yaml` and used to process schemas.
- The core components for database interaction and schema handling are in place.
