# Pipeline Structure Implementation Handoff - 2025-05-25

## Summary

Implemented a core pipeline structure using Chain of Responsibility and Builder patterns for the Text-to-SQL framework. Defined abstract `PipelineStep`, `Pipeline` (with nested `Builder`), and updated `PipelineContext` for extensible execution flow and context management, including conditional step execution.

## Priority Development Requirements (PDR)

-   **HIGH**: None directly from this structural work.
-   **MEDIUM**: Implement concrete `PipelineStep` instances for core components (Schema Pruning, Column Linking, Generation) as outlined in [`docs/planning/project_desc.md`](docs/planning/project_desc.md).
-   **LOW**: Explore and implement enhanced error handling and standardized logging within the pipeline structure.

## Discoveries

-   Iterative refinement of the `PipelineStep` design (adding `before`, `after`, `handle_execution`, `should_execute`, and adopting Chain of Responsibility) based on feedback led to a more robust and flexible step definition.
-   The need for conditional step execution (`should_execute`) was identified as a valuable addition for complex workflows.

## Problems & Solutions

-   **Problem**: Initial `PipelineStep` design was too simple for desired pre/post processing and core logic separation.
    **Solution**: Refactored `PipelineStep` to include `before`, `after`, and `handle_execution` methods.
-   **Problem**: Need for steps to delegate to the next in sequence (Chain of Responsibility).
    **Solution**: Added `_next_step` attribute and `link_with` method to `PipelineStep`, modifying `execute` to delegate.
    ```python
    # Example of pipeline creation flow
    from src.context.pipeline_context import PipelineContext
    from src.pipeline.pipeline import Pipeline
    from src.pipeline.noop_pipeline_step import NoOpPipelineStep

    # Create an initial context (assuming necessary initialization)
    initial_context = PipelineContext(db_engine=None, schema_engine=None) # Replace with actual initialization

    # Build the pipeline using the Builder
    pipeline = Pipeline[PipelineContext].Builder() \
        .add_step(NoOpPipelineStep("Step 1")) \
        .add_step(NoOpPipelineStep("Step 2")) \
        .add_step(NoOpPipelineStep("Step 3")) \
        .build()

    # Run the pipeline
    pipeline.run(initial_context)
    ```
-   **Problem**: Need for `PipelineContext` to track the last executed step.
    **Solution**: Added `_last_executed_step` field and `set_last_executed_step` method to `PipelineContext`.
-   **Problem**: User requested `PipelineBuilder` to be an inner class of `Pipeline`.
    **Solution**: Moved `PipelineBuilder` definition inside the `Pipeline` class.
-   **Problem**: (User-fixed) `ModuleNotFoundError` when running `main.py` directly due to absolute imports.
    **Solution**: (User fixed) Changed imports to relative paths within the `src` directory.

## Work in Progress

-   Implementing concrete `PipelineStep` classes for the Text-to-SQL components (0%).
-   Integrating the pipeline into the main application flow (0%).

## Deviations

-   Shifted from a simple list of steps in `Pipeline` to a Chain of Responsibility pattern for step execution, allowing steps to control the flow.
-   Made `PipelineBuilder` a nested class within `Pipeline` as requested.
